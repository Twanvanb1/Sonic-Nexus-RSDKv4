# **Sonic Nexus-RSDKv4**
A port of Sonic Nexus to RSDKv4

> This is made with standalone RSDKv4 in mind, so I can't guarantee that it will work on RSDKv5u  

## FAQ

### Q: I found a bug!
A: Submit them under the `issues` tab and I will try to fix it.

### Q: Will there be an Android, iOS, Steam Deck, etc port?
A: Everything in this project comes as-is. If it doesn't run on a specific platform, don't get your hopes up on it being fixed.

## Things that still need to be done.
- [ ] Add support for RSDKv5u
- [X] Make title card function properly on steam deck / MacBook Pro aspect ratio
- [ ] Fix collision issues
